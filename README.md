## Introduction

A lightweight implementation of the Jonckheere–Terpstra test for detecting ordered differences among three or more 
independent groups. This library provides both an asymptotic (normal approximation) and a permutation-based approach to 
compute the p-value and z-statistic for increasing, decreasing, or two-sided trends.


## Dependencies
The function requires the following Python packages:
- numpy
- scipy

## Usage
`pip install Jonckheere–Terpstra`


## Example
`ssa`
